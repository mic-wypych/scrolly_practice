# National Parks in the USA

<br>
The National Park System in the USA is in charge of caring for the 63 national parks located in the USA.
National Parks differ in the kinds of environment, landscape, animals and plants they have preserved. This presentation focuses on 15 parks with data available from [Tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-10-08/readme.md). You can see the map of parks [here](./#cr-map).

There are many species, many parks and unfortunately lots of missing information. We have the most information on amphibias, birds, fish, mammals, reptiles and vascular plants. There is little information on presence of bacteria, chromista nad protozoa in those parks
